### **Dataset Information**

The dataset selected for this project is created by Sumaia P. and is posted on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sumaiaparveenshupti/vancouver-bc-historical-crime-data). The data collection lists Vancouver's historical crime data from 2003 to 2021. The table shows the type of crime, the year, month, date, hour, and minute that they occurred, the location (hundred block) and neighborhood of the crime scene, and the x and y coordinate values projected in UTM zone 10. This collection has been released to the public by the Vancouver Police Department (VPD) with the intention of enhancing community awareness of policing activities in the city. The data provided is based on the information contained in the VPD Records Management System. Unfortunately, there is no information on how the data was collected. Still, it can be speculated that the values are based on historical records that have been digitized, as the historical crime data of past years are likely archived into a dataset such as this.
