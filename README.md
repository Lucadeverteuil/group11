### **Dataset Information**

The dataset selected for this project is created by Sumaia P. and is posted on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sumaiaparveenshupti/vancouver-bc-historical-crime-data). The data collection lists Vancouver's historical crime data from 2003 to 2021. The table shows the type of crime, the year, month, date, hour, and minute that they occurred, the location (hundred block) and neighborhood of the crime scene, and the x and y coordinate values projected in UTM zone 10. This collection has been released to the public by the Vancouver Police Department (VPD) with the intention of enhancing community awareness of policing activities in the city. The data provided is based on the information contained in the VPD Records Management System. Unfortunately, there is no information on how the data was collected. Still, it can be speculated that the values are based on historical records that have been digitized, as the historical crime data of past years are likely archived into a dataset such as this.

### **Project Topic**

We are very interested to find out the historical crime trends in Vancouver, as it is a city we visit often, and some of us are even planning to move there in the future. By gaining more awareness, we will be able to be more prepared to avoid encountering these crimes. The crime data will also likely be a valuable reference for the police department of Vancouver to predict crimes that may occur in the future and prepare means to handle them better.

Some questions that we would like to explore are:

- What is the most common type of crime overall and in each area?
- At what times do the crimes occur the most?
- Which years had the most criminal cases, and why is it so?
- Which areas are the most targeted? (eg. residential areas, business districts, parking lots, etc.)
- The frequency of crime rates vs the area of occurrence in Vancouver can be plotted. What does it look like on the city map?

##### **Luca Deverteuil:** This data set is really interesting because I am a huge crime drama nerd. With this analytical project I hope to be able to find what time of the year is worse with crime, and how serious of a crime is during these peaks. I have always heard that during the Holidays there is more crime. So with these stats I can see if this is true. I am also curious if this influx in crime also brings an influx in serious crime, meaning offense against another person and breaking and entering. I believe that The amount of serious crime will decrease during holiday periods however I think that petty crime like thief and mischief will increase. My belief on this is because people during these times are intoxicated and make decisions they probably should not have. As well as people are away on vacation so it would be easy to steal vehicles when people are not at their houses.
